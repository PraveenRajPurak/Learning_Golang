1. Set up the directories of the project and added files in them
2. Set up mongodb connection function in driver.go
3. Set up config.go for returning a struct that maintains error, info logging as well as validating the contents of any struct
3. Set up dbcol.go for returning specified collection in the specified db
4. Set up query.go to include a struct for has access of both the app tools defined in config.go and mongo.Client. We will define controllers as methods of this struct
5. Set up DBRepo.go to include an interface for listing out the functions that we will define in query.go. In this way, the struct defined in 4 will become a type of this interface
6. Modified main.go to call the driver's connection function
7. Defined Routes function in routes.go to accept the gin Engine(gin.New in our case) and the mongo.Client returned after successful establishment of the connection and return 
8. Prepared handlers to handle the controllers(that will be called in routes.go)
